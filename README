EGLBenchmark:
-------------

EGLBenchmark is a simple benchmark/testbench program to allow easy testing
of EGL and GLES2 primitives.

I wrote the program for the purpose of testing low level functionality
of graphics drivers on various platform and was having a lack of simple
test program, which meets the following requirements:

1) Minimal requirements. Only X11, EGL and GLES2. Nothing else
2) Small footprint
3) Easily expandable with a new test case

So here it is. With one simple class and test cases inherited from it.
Writing a new test case is a job of 5 minutes or less, if a primitive
level test case is required.

At the moment three test cases are included:

1) EGL initialisation and destruction
2) Simple shader program example
3) Simple triangle drawing example
4) Texturemapping test with ETC1 texture compression
5) Texturemapping test with regular RGB texturing

Even with these simple cases a dozen low level bugs have been pulled
out from the current GLES2 drivers.

Number of test cases will grow, as I see need for them.

Suggestions welcome.
